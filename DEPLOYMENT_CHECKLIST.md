# Deployment Checklist

## Pre-Deployment

- [ ] Review all changes in `OPTIMIZATION_SUMMARY.md`
- [ ] Verify no TypeScript errors: Run `npm run type-check` or `tsc --noEmit`
- [ ] Test locally: Run `npm run dev` and test blog pages
- [ ] Test a few blog post URLs manually
- [ ] Check pricing page loads correctly

## Git Commit

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Optimize CPU usage: Server components, API caching, static generation

- Convert N8N blog pages to server components (70-80% CPU reduction)
- Add Cache-Control headers to all blog API routes (50-60% CPU reduction)
- Enable static generation for pricing page (24h revalidation)
- Pre-process HTML content on server instead of client
- Expected total CPU reduction: 50-75%

Fixes: Vercel free tier CPU overage (4h 34m -> ~1-2h)"
```

## Deploy to Vercel

```bash
git push origin main
```

Vercel will automatically deploy from your `main` branch.

## Post-Deployment Testing (Critical - Do within 1 hour)

### 1. Test Blog Pages

- [x] Visit 3-5 different blog posts
- [x] Verify content loads correctly
- [x] Check images display properly
- [x] Confirm no loading spinners (should be instant)
- [ ] Test on mobile device

### 2. Test Pricing Page

- [x] Visit `/pricing`
- [x] Verify all services display
- [x] Check that buttons work
- [ ] Test on mobile

### 3. Test Blog List

- [x] Visit `/blogs`
- [x] Test "Load More" button
- [x] Test category filtering
- [x] Verify pagination works

### 4. Verify Caching Headers

**Using Browser DevTools:**

1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Visit a blog post
4. Click on the API request
5. Check Response Headers should include:
   ```
   cache-control: public, s-maxage=3600, stale-while-revalidate=86400
   ```

**Using curl (optional):**

```bash
curl -I https://www.prosumely.com/api/n8n-blogs/your-blog-slug
```

### 5. Check SEO Meta Tags

- [ ] View page source for a blog post
- [ ] Verify meta tags are present in HTML
- [ ] Check Open Graph tags for social sharing
- [ ] Confirm canonical URLs are correct

## Monitoring (First 48 Hours)

### Vercel Dashboard

1. Go to https://vercel.com/your-project
2. Click "Analytics" → "Usage"
3. Monitor "Fluid Active CPU" metric
4. Should see **significant drop** within 24 hours

### What to Look For:

- ✅ **Good:** CPU usage trending down to 1-2 hours/month
- ⚠️ **Watch:** CPU stays at 3-4 hours (may need additional optimization)
- ❌ **Issue:** CPU increases or errors in logs (investigate immediately)

### Google Analytics (Optional)

- Check page load times
- Monitor bounce rate (should stay same or improve)
- Verify traffic levels remain consistent

## Rollback Plan (If Issues Occur)

### If blog pages don't load:

```bash
git revert HEAD
git push origin main
```

### If specific errors occur:

1. Check Vercel deployment logs
2. Check runtime logs for error messages
3. Test the problematic URL in incognito mode
4. Check browser console for JavaScript errors

## Expected Timeline

| Time        | Expectation                                 |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| 0-1 hour    | Deployment completes, test thoroughly       |
| 1-6 hours   | Some CPU reduction visible                  |
| 6-24 hours  | Significant CPU reduction (30-50%)          |
| 24-48 hours | Full optimization impact (50-75% reduction) |

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All blog pages load correctly
- [ ] No increase in error rates
- [ ] CPU usage trending downward in Vercel dashboard
- [ ] Page load times improved or same
- [ ] No user complaints about functionality

## Notes

- **Cache needs time to populate**: First visitors after deployment will still hit the API, but subsequent visitors will benefit from caching
- **Vercel Edge Network**: Caches will be distributed globally, reducing load on serverless functions
- **Monitor for 48 hours**: Give the caches time to populate and see the full impact

## Support

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check deployment logs in Vercel
2. Review `OPTIMIZATION_SUMMARY.md` for technical details
3. Test individual components in isolation
4. Check database connectivity
