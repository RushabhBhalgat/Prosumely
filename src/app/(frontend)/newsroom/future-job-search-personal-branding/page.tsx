            <p className="text-gray-800">
              Imagine this: before a recruiter even opens your resume, they've Googled your name.
              Your LinkedIn profile pops up, followed by your Twitter feed and maybe a blog you
              wrote three years ago. Whether you realize it or not, you've already made an
              impression—without saying a word. Welcome to the age of personal branding, where your
              digital footprint carries as much weight as your professional experience.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-800">
              In this new era, the resume is just one piece of a much larger puzzle. Personal
              branding has evolved from a buzzword into a powerful career strategy. It's what sets
              you apart from hundreds of equally qualified professionals. This article explores why
              personal branding is now a non-negotiable part of job searching, how it complements
              your resume, and how Prosumely helps you craft a unified, authentic professional
              image.

              What Is Personal Branding, Really?
            </h2>
            <p className="text-gray-800">
              Personal branding is the intentional effort to influence public perception of who you
              are, what you stand for, and what you bring to the table. It's not just about building
              a flashy LinkedIn profile—it's about establishing your identity in a way that
              resonates with your target industry, role, or employer.
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc ml-6 text-gray-800">
              <li>Your unique value proposition.</li>
              <li>Your career direction and expertise.</li>
              <li>Your credibility and professionalism.</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="text-gray-800">
              Your resume should reflect this brand, but it doesn't stop there. It carries over to
              your LinkedIn profile, your online presence, your interview style, and even your
              networking conversations.
            </p>

              The Resume as a Branding Tool
            </h2>
            <p className="text-gray-800">
              A resume isn't just a document. It's your story. And like any good brand story, it
              should be consistent, compelling, and clearly positioned.
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc ml-6 text-gray-800">
              <li>A clear, professional headline that defines your identity.</li>
              <li>A personal summary that outlines your values, expertise, and goals.</li>
              <li>Career highlights that focus on results and leadership.</li>
              <li>Consistent language, tone, and themes throughout.</li>
            </ul>

              LinkedIn as Your Digital Twin
            </h2>
            <p className="text-gray-800">
              Your LinkedIn profile is more than just a copy-paste of your resume. It's your
              personal brand hub. Recruiters often check LinkedIn before contacting a candidate. If
              your profile is vague, outdated, or inconsistent with your resume, it raises red
              flags.
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc ml-6 text-gray-800">
              <li>A compelling headline that showcases your unique selling point.</li>
              <li>An About section written in first-person for authenticity.</li>
              <li>Rich media (videos, posts, recommendations) that reinforce your expertise.</li>
              <li>
                Active engagement (likes, comments, shares) that position you as a thought leader.
              </li>

              The Rise of the Portfolio Mindset
            </h2>
            <p className="text-gray-800">
              Professionals today are increasingly treating their careers like a portfolio of
              projects, not just a linear progression. This is especially true for freelancers,
              consultants, and creatives, but it's becoming mainstream for all roles.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-800">
              A personal website, GitHub profile, Medium blog, or Behance portfolio adds depth to
              your brand. It allows you to demonstrate thought leadership, showcase work samples,
              and control the narrative of your expertise.

              The Danger of Inconsistency
            </h2>
            <p className="text-gray-800">
              One of the biggest mistakes professionals make is having a strong resume, but a weak
              LinkedIn profile—or worse, social media content that contradicts their brand.
              Inconsistent branding dilutes trust.

              <li>Does your online presence reflect the professionalism of your resume?</li>
              <li>Is your career narrative cohesive across platforms?</li>
              <li>
                Are you sending the same message in interviews, cover letters, and networking calls?
