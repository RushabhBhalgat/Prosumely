      answer:
        'An ATS-optimized resume is a document strategically written and formatted to be successfully read and ranked by Applicant Tracking System (ATS) software.

    {
      question: 'Who needs an ATS resume?',
      answer:
        "Virtually any professional applying for jobs online today needs an ATS resume.

This service is essential for everyone from entry-level professionals to senior managers.",

      question: "Why can't I just use a fancy online template?",
      answer:
        'While many templates look visually appealing, they are often a liability.

      question: 'Is the ATS resume enough, or should I consider the Executive Resume?',

      question: 'How is your service different from using an AI resume builder?',
      answer:
